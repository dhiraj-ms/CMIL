## Literature Review
Whenever I am given data from any domain, be it health science, plant science, finance, etc., I try my best to first gain a foundational understanding of the problem from a domain-specific perspective. In this case, I started by studying literature related to glomeruli to understand what happens in sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli. My goal was to understand the biological significance of the problem and explore how machine learning has been applied in similar tasks. I reviewed papers that solved similar classification problems, which helped me understand the previous methodologies used and the results that could be expected. Having experience across different domains such as health science and plant science, I understand that expectations for results and approaches vary across fields.

One paper I found by Pesce et al. [1], discussed the implementation of machine learning to classify sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli. This paper introduced two approaches: traditional feature extraction and deep learning. In the feature extraction approach, I learned about using morphological and textural features for classification. Morphological features such as measurements of Bowmanâ€™s capsule and glomerular diameters, and textural features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Haralick texture descriptors were discussed. I was previously unfamiliar with these specific features, so I did some research on how they are defined and calculated. Based on my reading, I understood that morphological features are crucial because sclerosis alters the structure of the glomeruli. Hence, quantitative metrics like changes in area, width, or shape could help identify sclerotic glomeruli. On the other hand, textural features may depend on the image collection process. The second approach mentioned in the paper was deep learning-based. The machine learning model based on hand-crafted features seemed more explainable, however I realized that I would need detailed information about the images, such as how they were collected and acceptable parameter ranges which would require help from medical experts. Therefore, I decided to focus on automatic feature extraction using deep learning models.

Since morphological features are critical, I read another paper by Pinter et al. [2], which used variational autoencoders for automatic morphological feature extraction. It showed promise for extracting relevant features across several classes. These two papers laid the foundation for my approach, and I decided to use deep learning for automatic feature extraction rather than relying on manual feature extraction, which could introduce errors/bias without medical expertise.
